Step 1: Download the Extension

    Download the Blobber extension zip file from the link provided.

Step 2: Extract the Zip File

    Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to a location on your computer.

Step 3: Open Firefox and Access the Add-ons Manager

    Open Firefox.
    Click on the menu button (three horizontal lines) in the upper-right corner of the browser.
    Select "Add-ons and themes" from the menu.
    In the Add-ons Manager tab, click on the gear icon next to "Manage Your Extensions" and select "Debug Add-ons."

Step 4: Load the Extension

    Click the "Load Temporary Add-on" button.
    Navigate to the folder where you extracted the Blobber extension.
    Select the manifest.json file and click "Open."

Step 5: Using Blobber

    Once the extension is loaded, you should see a green circle icon in the Firefox toolbar.
    Click on the green circle icon to open the Blobber popup window.
    In the popup window, you will see buttons for "Download All," "Download All Videos," and "Download All Images."
    Click the appropriate button to download media files from the currently active tab.

Additional Notes

    The extension will automatically detect images and videos on the currently active tab.
    You can scroll through the detected media links in the Blobber popup window.
    The "Scroll to Top" button will appear when you scroll down, allowing you to quickly return to the top of the popup window.

This method loads the extension temporarily and will be removed when you restart Firefox. To load the extension permanently, you need to follow the steps for creating and loading an unlisted extension through Firefox's Add-ons site or developer tools.
